## Functional Blocks

* dpad\_test - This is a small test swatch for metal dome switch PCB trace. This also contains wire holders on the side which (for future reference) work really well for 22 AWG solid core wire.

* dpad\_tactile - This is a 3 piece jig for holding OMRON B3F-1000 tactile switches into a dpad configuration. A 2015 new nintendo 3ds (non XL) dpad and silicon mask go on top of the cover and underneath the dpad holder.
